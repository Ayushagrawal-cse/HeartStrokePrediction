❤️ Heart Disease Risk Predictor
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts the risk of heart disease using a trained Logistic Regression model. Users can input basic health metrics and lifestyle indicators, and the app will assess whether they are at high or low risk for heart disease.

🚀 Features
- 🔍 Predicts heart disease risk using logistic regression
- 📊 Scales input data using a pre-trained StandardScaler
- 🧠 Encodes categorical variables with one-hot encoding
- 🎨 Clean and interactive UI with dark/light mode support
- 📁 Loads model, scaler, and expected columns from .pkl files
